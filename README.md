# BF2SE-Multi-Tool
An very unfinished plugin that allows to play around with (some) features from [BF2SE](https://github.com/maguc00/BF2SE) via the help of [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and [minHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook).
To enable the GUI press F11.
# Installation
Place `Multi-Tool.dll` into your `plugins` folder found inside your BF2 installation folder. If the plugins folder doesn't exist, create one.
